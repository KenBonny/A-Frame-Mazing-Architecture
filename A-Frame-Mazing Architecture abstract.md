# A-Frame-Mazing Architecture: The Love Triangle of Software Design

Ever wondered what would happen if your code had a romantic comedy plotline? Welcome to A-Frame Architecture! Meet Infrastructure: the down-to-earth realist who talks to databases and juggles file systems, Logic: the pure-hearted idealist who makes all the decisions, and Controller: the matchmaker who keeps the other two from awkward encounters.

In this talk, we'll explore how to maintain this peculiar love triangle while keeping everyone happy and preventing Infrastructure from randomly crashing Logic's party with unexpected database calls. We'll dive into why Entity Framework doesn't need yet another repository wrapper, and why copying code might sometimes be better than creating the one ring... err... class to rule them all.

Warning: May contain dad jokes about dependency injection and mild rants about overengineering. No repositories were harmed in the making of this presentation.
